            This cat has come to the family 3 years ago when i and my girlfriend found it along side with her brothers, all of them were very small and she was the first one to say hello to my GF and she says if we can keep this one, of course i cannot say no.

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>2021</strong>
                - One spring morning my girlfriend's mom wakes us up saying the there are sounds coming from the wood shed, he said that it was the sound of cats and that one of the neighbor's cats gave birth in the shed. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>2022</strong>
                - It's been almost a year since we had Six, she's very curios and always accepts cuddles from us. Sometimes we don't even have anything to do because if we just lie down she's on our chest or next to us waiting to be cuddled. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>2022</strong>
                - It happen once when we were very scared, we still don't know what the cause was, but we think she was just constipated. She likes to go hunting but often she just played with the prey, but this time she ate it and it didn't go well at all. We went with her to the vet but she struggled for a week, she was always crying and worse at night. We were very afraid that she might have broken something. She was eating very little and not moving too much.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>2023</strong>
                - I worked at a cat food warehouse at the time and almost every week we received packages of food and what do you see, she liked it a lot. She gained weight and we were worried that she was eating too much, we fed her 3 times a day and she still wanted food, sometimes she still got treats or very small snacks.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>2024</strong>
                - Today she is a healthy, cute cat and does not bring bad luck at all. She continues to be playful and cuddly, so I recommend everyone to adopt a black cat.
